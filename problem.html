          Many people have projects and/or tasks involving the need for small 
          parts. This leads to them not knowing how much they have of each part. 
          This leads to them to over buying or not buying enough of a part in 
          order to do the task. This is an important issue because of the idea 
          that they will spend too much money on that tool, having too much for
          a waste. They also could have loot less and they will not be able to 
          complete that project. The goal for the project is to efficiently 
          present the amount of small parts in each compartment. This will 
          leads to them knowing how many items they have, knowing if they need
          to buy more or not. Another issue that we are trying to solve is the
          idea to have an affordable tool organizer that will be able to be 
          commercial. Another issue that we this is a new invention that no 
          other product can offer. This means that this is a new idea and will 
          help a new group of people. No corporation believed that this was an 
          issue, however, in our studies, discovered that many people will enjoy
          the idea and what the creation to be around.
