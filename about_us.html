            <p>My name is Sragvi Vadali and I am cuurently in the ninth grade. 
            I am interested in computer programing, cuurent taking AP Computer 
            Science Priniples. I also and a part of many clubs regarding 
            engineering, such as Vex Robotics. From the beginning of the year, 
            I was in the gael force robotics 5327 B team. This is a major honor 
            since only a handful are picked in each team. I decided to do this 
            project because I went through the pain of having too less parts, 
            and I don't want others to feel that pain.  </p>

            <p>My name in Shreejith Ravisankar and I am
            currently a student in 10th grade at Dublin High
            school taking the engineering pathway.  
            In the future, I plan on being an engineer, 
            specifically a robotics engineer. I am in the robotics 
            club, where we build robots and make them perform certain
            tasks at international level tournaments. I hope, in the 
            future to come up with an invention that would 
            revolutionize the world. Hopefully, My invention is 
            something that everybody would use, but as the world is 
            changing quickly, so are the inventions and innovations.
            Personal I love building and problem-solving. Math word 
            problems are where I jam. Even though sometimes it gets 
            too hard, I still go back at it and try again.</p>

            <p>I am currently a freshman at Dublin High School. My name is Vedant Agrawal, and I recently turned 14 years old. I was selected as an intern for a VEX Robotics Competition team, 5327C, at the end of 8th grade. Throughout the summer, I went to their meets and contributed to the team, and when the school year started, I was accepted as an official part of their team. In addition to that, I am currently taking Computer Science Principles as my elective. </p>
